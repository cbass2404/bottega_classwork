I'm gonna first perform some quality check here. So I wanna make sure that this process here on line two, I wanna make sure that that worked. So I'm gonna say if the queried_file.mode is equal to 'r' then I wanna perform a task. And the reason why I'm doing that, we technically do not need that for this specific case but imagine a scenario where you're performing all kinds of tasks for a file. So you may be writing, you may be appending and you may be doing all of them in the same class or even in the same function.

And if you're doing that, you wanna make sure that when you are reading the file that you're actually in read mode. So that's all we're doing here and I also just wanted to show you this mode function. This gives you the ability to call a file object and to be able to see what type of mode it's in, whether it's in write mode, read more, or append.
