# Structural vs Behavorial Diagrams

>Structural Diagrams

-Structural diagrams are any type of diagrams that model the way a system is architected. In other words, a class diagram is one of the most popular structural diagrams out there. It's a way of defining the different class names, attributes, and method names that belong inside of a system that you're building.

>Behavioral Diagrams

-Behavioral diagrams are much different, behavioral diagrams care about how your system behaves. It cares about different things like what type of messages does one system send to another or what types of permissions does user A have versus User B. Those are the types of questions that you're going to model out inside of behavioral systems.
